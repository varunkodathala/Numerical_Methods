## Numerical Analysis

**This Page gives the insight of technical dimension of Numerical Analysis (Computational Methods) in the field of Mathematics and Engineering**

_Numerical Methods is extensively useful for any standardised mathematical and engineering applications_

_Examples:_

- _Solar Cell Analysis_
- _Air Dynamics_
- _PDE's solution in Image Processing_
- _Optimisation Problems_
